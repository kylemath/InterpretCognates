{"role":"user","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"<user_query>\n@README.md working on a program in @bac@backend to study the interpretability of neural networks representation of semantic equivalent words and phrases (translation). I have gotten pretty far and have some nice graphs, but I want to move towards testing and answering some deep questions about how NN represent and do translation compared to polyglots. Please create subagents to first do a research and analysis deep dive and think about other work and what we have and ideas, and then to \"meet\" to contribute to a simuted meeting  in which they discuss the project in a shared .md file. A meeting secretary summarizes and organizes this document during the meeting. The meeting lead agent then creates an executive summary of the meeting minutes and how they should educate our work on this project. \n\nEach subagent should look for real references with links and pdfs to working papers and provide the doi and apa reference. The papers should be summarized in a bib.md file for each agent with this info and a description of main points and ideas from that paper. \n\nSubagents should suggest code and steps based on our existing codebase\n</user_query>"}]}}

{"role":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Now I have a thorough picture of the codebase. Let me set up the full multi-agent research and meeting workflow. I'll create the research directory, then launch the two research agents in parallel, followed by the secretary and meeting lead.\n\nNow I have a thorough understanding of the codebase. Let me create the multi-agent workflow:\n\n1. **Research Agent A** - NLP/Neural Network Interpretability specialist - researches multilingual representation, mechanistic interpretability of translation models\n2. **Research Agent B** - Cognitive Linguistics/Polyglot specialist - researches how polyglots cognitively represent language, bilingualism neuroscience, psycholinguistics\n3. **Secretary Agent** - reads both agents' research and organizes a shared meeting.md\n4. **Meeting Lead Agent** - creates executive summary\n\nLet me plan the output files:\n- `/Users/kylemathewson/InterpretCognates/research/agent_a_bib.md` - NLP interpretability research\n\n\n- `/Users/kylemathewson/InterpretCognates/research/agent_b_bib.md` - Cognitive linguistics/polyglot research\n- `/Users/kylemathewson/InterpretCognates/research/meeting.md` - shared meeting document\n- `/Users/kylemathewson/InterpretCognates/research/executive_summary.md` - final summary\n\nI'll instantiate these four agents in sequence: the NLP researcher and cognitive science researcher will each compile their bibliographies, then the secretary will synthesize both into a meeting document, and finally the lead agent will distill everything into an executive summary.\n\nNow I need to craft the prompts carefully, making sure each agent has enough context about the codebase and their specific responsibilities."}]}}

{"role":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"All four files are in place. Here's what was produced:\n\n---\n\n## What was built\n\nAll files are in `/Users/kylemathewson/InterpretCognates/research/`:\n\n| File | Size | Contents |\n|---|---|---|\n| `agent_a_bib.md` | 42K | 10 verified NLP/interpretability papers with DOIs, APA citations, summaries, and 8 experiment ideas |\n| `agent_b_bib.md` | 63K | 13 verified cognitive science/psycholinguistics papers with DOIs, APA citations, summaries, and 10 experiment ideas |\n| `meeting.md` | 37K | ~3,200 words of structured interdisciplinary meeting transcript across 7 agenda items, with genuine debate, ranked experiment table, and codebase gap analysis |\n| `executive_summary.md` | 36K | Fully actionable roadmap — 10 prioritized development tasks with code sketches, 3 novel hypotheses, methodological cautions, and a scoped 2-week first sprint |\n\n---\n\n## Highlights from the meeting\n\n**Sharpest finding:** Your current `cross_attention_map()` averages all heads and layers together — both agents agreed this is methodologically incoherent for making mechanistic claims. The per-head decomposition is the first thing to fix.\n\n**Two foundational fixes (low effort, high validity impact):**\n1. **Isotropy correction** — subtract the global mean + top-k PCA directions before computing cosine similarity (fixes the anisotropy bias documented in Rajaee & Pilehvar, 2022)\n2. **Language mean-centering** — subtract each language's mean vector to reveal a purer \"conceptual store\" layer, which directly tests the cognitive science Revised Hierarchical Model\n\n**The novel hypothesis no prior paper has tested:** Does NLLB's cosine distance between translation pairs correlate with phylogenetic distance from the ASJP database (Jäger, 2018)? If yes, the model has implicitly learned proto-language structure.\n\n**Recommended first sprint (2 weeks):** isotropy correction → Swadesh core vocabulary test → Mantel phylogenetic correlation → per-head attention decomposition."}]}}
