{"role":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Looking at the image, the error bars are quite cluttered and don't add much -- the key story is the position of each concept dot (phonetic similarity vs. embedding convergence) and the category coloring. The error bars just say \"there's variance across language pairs,\" which is expected and not particularly informative for this visualization. Removing them will make the plot much cleaner and more readable.\n\nLet me remove the error bars from the JS and update the caption.\n\nNow I can see the error bars are on line 337. I need to remove them. Let me also look at the attached image to assess what Figure 3 is showing.\n\nLooking at the image provided by the user, Figure 3 is a scatter plot showing Swadesh concepts plotted by mean cross-lingual phonetic similarity (x-axis) vs. embedding convergence (y-axis, isotropy-corrected). Each dot has error bars (±1 standard deviation). The dots are colored by semantic category.\n\nThe error bars are quite noisy and make the plot harder to read. The scatter itself shows that there's no strong correlation between phonetic similarity and embedding convergence - concepts converge at various levels regardless of their phonetic similarity. The important information is:\n\n\nThe position of each concept and the semantic category coloring matter most, while the error bars just add clutter without much insight. Removing them will clean up the visualization significantly. I should also update the figure caption to reflect this change, then apply the modifications to both blog.js files."}]}}

{"role":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Done. Here's what I changed and my assessment:\n\n**Changes made:**\n- Removed error bars from the Figure 3 convergence scatter in both `backend/app/static/blog.js` and `docs/blog.js`\n- Updated the Figure 3 caption in `blog.html` to remove the error bar description\n\n**Is this figure showing anything vital?**\n\nThe scatter itself is valuable -- it tests whether embedding convergence is driven by surface-form similarity (cognates/shared spelling) or something deeper. The key finding is that there's **no strong correlation** between phonetic similarity (x-axis) and embedding convergence (y-axis): concepts like \"star,\" \"name,\" and \"hand\" converge strongly despite high phonetic distance, while \"louse\" and \"feather\" are low-convergence despite moderate phonetic similarity. This directly supports the paper's thesis that NLLB captures genuine conceptual universals beyond surface form.\n\nThe **upper-left quadrant** (high convergence, low phonetic similarity) is the money zone -- those are the strongest candidates for true conceptual universals. The category coloring also reveals that Nature and Body terms tend to cluster at higher convergence, which aligns with Swadesh's cultural stability hypothesis.\n\nSo the scatter plot itself is editorially important. The error bars were just visual noise -- they made the plot harder to parse without conveying an insight that the standard deviation numbers in the hover tooltips don't already provide."}]}}
