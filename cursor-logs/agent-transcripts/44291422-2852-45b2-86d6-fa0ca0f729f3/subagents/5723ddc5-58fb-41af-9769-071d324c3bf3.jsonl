Then I'm starting a new word, coffee, and listing its translations across major European languages, Russian, Polish, and Hindi.\n\nContinuing with coffee across more languages—Hindi, Persian, Greek, Romanian, Dutch, Swedish, Bengali, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Tagalog, and Swahili.\n\nNow moving through additional languages like Yoruba, Hausa, Finnish, Hungarian, Georgian, Tamil, Telugu, Burmese, Khmer, Amharic, Basque, Mongolian, and Uzbek, then starting on tea in English and Spanish.\n\nContinuing with tea translations across French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Polish, Hindi, Persian, Greek, Romanian, Dutch, Swedish, Bengali, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, and Turkish.\n\nNow I'm expanding the list to include Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Tagalog, Swahili, Yoruba, Hausa, Finnish, Hungarian, Georgian, Tamil, Telugu, Burmese, Khmer, Amharic, and Basque translations.\n\nContinuing with Mongolian, Kazakh, and Uzbek variants, then moving on to compile sugar translations across English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Polish, Hindi, Persian, Greek, Romanian, Dutch, and Swedish. I'm continuing through the translations, working through Georgian and then moving into Tamil, Telugu, Burmese, and other languages. I need to double-check the Mongolian entry since \"sugar\" has a couple of valid options—I'll go with the borrowed Russian term \"сахар\" as the cleaner choice. Now I'm moving into Kazakh and Uzbek before starting on rice translations.\n\nContinuing with rice across Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Polish, Hindi, Persian, Greek, Romanian, Dutch, and Swedish. For Bengali I'm choosing the uncooked form \"চাল\" over the cooked variant, and for Mandarin I'm picking \"米\" as the most straightforward option. Still working through the remaining languages. Continuing through the translations for rice across more languages, working through Georgian, Tamil, Telugu, Burmese, Khmer, Amharic, Basque, and the Mongolic languages where I'm deciding between options like тутарга versus цагаан будаа for Mongolian, then Kazakh and Uzbek.

Compiling translations for beer across multiple languages... Now I'm continuing through more language translations for beer, including Burmese, Khmer, Amharic, and several others, then moving on to compile translations for \"glass\" across different writing systems and languages. Now I'm working through the Tagalog translation for glass—\"salamin\" works for the material even though it can also mean mirror, so I'll stick with that. I'm also adding translations for Swahili, Yoruba, and Hausa to complete the list.\n\nContinuing with more languages for glass across Finnish, Hungarian, Georgian, Tamil, Telugu, Burmese, Khmer, Amharic, Basque, Khalkha Mongolian, Kazakh, and Uzbek. Then moving on to paper with the major European languages.\n\nNow I'm adding the remaining translations for paper across Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Polish, Hindi, Persian, Greek, Romanian, Dutch, Swedish, Bengali, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, and Turkish.\n\nContinuing with Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Tagalog, Swahili, Yoruba, Hausa, Finnish, Hungarian, Georgian, Tamil, Telugu, Burmese, Khmer, Amharic, and Basque.\n\nNow I'm adding the remaining translations for paper in Mongolian, Kazakh, and Uzbek, then moving on to cotton across major European and Asian languages.

Now I'm compiling translations for \"freedom\" across multiple languages and scripts, then moving on to gather the word \"justice\" in various languages as well. Continuing through more language translations for justice—Filipino, Swahili, Yoruba, Hausa, Finnish, Hungarian, Georgian, Tamil, Telugu, Burmese, Khmer, Amharic, and Basque all have their own distinct terms for this concept.\n\nNow moving into Mongolian and Kazakh variants, then shifting to compile translations for revolution across a broader set of languages including Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Polish, Hindi, Persian, Greek, Romanian, Dutch, Swedish, and Bengali.\n\nContinuing with East Asian languages like Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean, then covering Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Tagalog, Swahili, Yoruba, Hausa, and Finnish translations.\n\nNow I'm adding more language variants including Hungarian, Georgian, Tamil, Telugu, Burmese, Khmer, Amharic, Basque, Mongolian, Kazakh, and Uzbek for the same concept, then moving into the science category starting with English, Spanish, French, and German. Continuing through the translations for the remaining languages, covering Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Tagalog, Swahili, Yoruba, Hausa, Finnish, Hungarian, Georgian, Tamil, Telugu, and Burmese. Continuing through the translations for religion across more languages, including Hindi, Persian, Greek, Romanian, Dutch, Swedish, Bengali, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, and Tagalog. Now I'm compiling translations for \"law\" across multiple languages, mapping each language code to its corresponding term in that script system. Now I'm continuing through translations for \"law\" across more languages, then moving into the word \"war\" and its equivalents across different writing systems and languages. Continuing through the translations for \"war\" across more languages—Finnish, Hungarian, Georgian, Tamil, Telugu, Burmese, Khmer, Amharic, Basque, Mongolian, and Uzbek—then moving into the translations for \"peace\" starting with English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese. Continuing through more translations of \"peace\" across additional languages like Indonesian, Tagalog, Swahili, and others, working through the full linguistic spectrum.\n\nNow moving into the \"education\" section with translations across major languages—English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Polish, Hindi, Persian, Greek, and Romanian.\n\nContinuing with more language variants for education including Dutch, Swedish, Bengali, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Tagalog, Swahili, Yoruba, and Hausa.\n\nNow I've compiled translations across all 60 language concepts and I'm ready to structure this into a JSON file. Wait, let me double-check my count:\nTechnology & Modern (12): telephone, computer, television, radio, camera, electricity, airplane, bicycle, car, train, newspaper, clock ✓\nInstitutional (10): school, university, hospital, bank, police, church, prison, parliament, army, court ✓\nCommerce & Urban (10): money, market, shop, restaurant, hotel, office, company, city, road, bridge ✓\nCultural (8): music, dance, wedding, sport, game, theater, art, poetry ✓\nFood & Materials (10): coffee, tea, sugar, rice, bread, wine, beer, glass, paper, cotton ✓\nAbstract Social (10): democracy, freedom, justice, revolution, science, religion, law, war, peace, education ✓\n\nThat gives me 60 total. Now I'm working through the JSON carefully, particularly for Basque—I need to decide whether to use bare forms or dictionary forms with the definite article. Looking at the existing entries, it seems the pattern is to use the base form without articles, so I'll stick with that approach for consistency. I'm going through the Basque vocabulary list and standardizing it to dictionary forms without articles, which is cleaner for this cross-lingual analysis. I'm continuing through the vocabulary list with more abstract concepts like democracy, freedom, and justice, then moving into a large JSON file that needs careful attention to special characters and diacritical marks, particularly for Yoruba's tonal marks and Hausa's unique consonants.\n\nNow I'm making some final adjustments to specific translations—choosing \"caméra\" for French, \"macchina\" for Italian car, and verifying the Hindi term for telephone before finalizing the complete JSON structure. I'm still working through the Tagalog word for glass—\"salamin\" is the most versatile term even though it technically refers to mirrors and eyeglasses, since it can encompass the material itself in broader usage. For Mongolian, I'm settling on \"сахар\" for sugar since it's the standard term for granulated sugar, and I'm reconsidering the rice translation, leaning toward \"цагаан будаа\" as the more specific descriptor.\n\nNow I'm compiling a more comprehensive list of Mongolian vocabulary for common modern objects and concepts—telephone, computer, television, radio, camera, electricity, airplane, bicycle, car, train, newspaper, and clock—making sure I'm using the most accurate contemporary terms rather than outdated or overly formal versions. I'm settling on the standard Yoruba term for electricity—\"mọ̀nàmọ́ná\" is the most direct word for it, though \"iná mọ̀nàmọ́ná\" (electric fire) is also used colloquially. Now I'm ready to compile everything into the final output. I need to clarify which sense of \"glass\" I'm using here—the material or the drinking vessel. Since it's categorized under \"Food & Materials,\" I should go with the material meaning. For Thai, กระจก is the right choice for glass as a material, and for Vietnamese, \"thủy tinh\" is more precise than \"kính\" which refers to eyeglasses. Now I'm ready to compile the final corrections and write out the file.\n\nFor Amharic, ብርጭቆ works for the glass material. For Tagalog, I'm settling on \"kristal\" since there's no perfect single word—\"baso\" is the drinking vessel, \"salamin\" is mirror or eyeglasses, and \"bubog\" specifically means broken glass, so \"kristal\" best captures the material sense.\n\nFor French, I'll use \"caméra\" for camera since it covers both film and general usage. I've confirmed that electricity isn't on the Swadesh list, so there's no overlap with the 100-word list. Now I need to construct the actual file, which will be quite lengthy. I'm also finalizing the Mongolian entries—\"сахар\" for sugar and \"будаа\" for rice, since that's the more common modern usage rather than the literary \"тутарга.\"\n\nLet me verify the other language entries: Yoruba \"eré ìdárayá\" for sport is correct, and Hausa \"wasa\" works too. Now I'm ready to write out the full JSON file, making sure the format is valid and matches exactly. I'm finalizing some language-specific word choices for the translations—using \"пиво\" for Mongolian beer since it's the modern standard despite the traditional \"шар айраг,\" and confirming the Yoruba renderings for telephone and computer are correct. Now I need to make sure each of the 40 language codes has complete translations for all concepts before writing out the file. Continuing through the language codes and now I'm ready to construct the full JSON structure with all the language entries."}]}}
