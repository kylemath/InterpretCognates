{"role":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"I've read the format. Now I'll create the file with all 60 concepts translated into 40 languages, matching the exact structure of the Swadesh file.\n\nGood, I now understand the exact format. Each concept has all 40 language codes as keys with their translations. Let me now create the non_swadesh_60.json file with 60 concepts and translations in all 40 languages.\n\nLet me carefully compile accurate translations for all 60 concepts across all 40 languages. This is a large task that requires careful attention to accuracy.\n\nLet me organize this systematically. The 40 languages are:\n\n1. eng_Latn - English\n2. spa_Latn - Spanish\n3. fra_Latn - French\n4. deu_Latn - German\n\n\n5. ita_Latn - Italian\n6. por_Latn - Portuguese\n7. rus_Cyrl - Russian\n8. pol_Latn - Polish\n9. hin_Deva - Hindi\n10. pes_Arab - Persian\n11. ell_Grek - Greek\n12. ron_Latn - Romanian\n13. nld_Latn - Dutch\n14. swe_Latn - Swedish\n15. ben_Beng - Bengali\n16. zho_Hans - Chinese (Simplified)\n17. jpn_Jpan - Japanese\n18. kor_Hang - Korean\n19. ara_Arab - Arabic\n20. heb_Hebr - Hebrew\n21. tur_Latn - Turkish\n22. vie_Latn - Vietnamese\n23. tha_Thai - Thai\n24. ind_Latn - Indonesian\n25. tgl_Latn - Tagalog\n26. swh_Latn - Swahili\n27. yor_Latn - Yoruba\n28. hau_Latn - Hausa\n29. fin_Latn - Finnish\n30. hun_Latn - Hungarian\n31. kat_Geor - Georgian\n32. tam_Taml - Tamil\n33. tel_Telu - Telugu\n34. mya_Mymr - Burmese\n35. khm_Khmr - Khmer\n36. amh_Ethi - Amharic\n\nContinuing through the language codes, covering Arabic through Amharic and various other languages across different scripts and regions.\n\nNow I'm working through the 60 concepts that need translation across all these languages, starting with the technology and modern category. I need to be careful to use the correct native scripts for each language as I compile the translations for telephone and the other concepts. Continuing through the translations for \"telephone\" across more languages—Indonesian, Tagalog, Swahili, Yoruba, Hausa, Finnish, Hungarian, Georgian, Tamil, Telugu, Burmese, Khmer, Amharic, Basque, and Mongolian all have their own variations of the word.\n\nNow moving on to \"computer\" and compiling translations across a similar range of languages, from Spanish and French to Hindi, Persian, Greek, Romanian, Dutch, and Swedish, noting regional preferences like \"computadora\" being more universal in Spanish than \"ordenador.\" I'm continuing through the translations, now working through Finnish, Hungarian, and several other languages before moving on to television as the next word.

Continuing with translations for \"company\" across multiple languages, working through the various scripts and regional variants. Continuing through more translations for \"company\" across additional languages like Finnish, Hungarian, Georgian, and Tamil, then moving into the next word which appears to be \"city.\" Continuing through more language translations for \"city\"...\n\nnow moving on to \"road\" and compiling its translations across different languages and scripts. Continuing through the translations for \"road\" across more languages, then moving on to compile the translations for \"bridge\" across a similar set of languages. I'm continuing through the translation list, moving into more languages like Finnish, Hungarian, and Georgian, then shifting into a cultural category with music as the next concept to translate across different language systems.

I'm working through the Mongolian translation for sugar—there's some ambiguity between \"чихэр\" (which typically means candy), \"элсэн чихэр\" (granulated sugar specifically), and \"сахар\" (the common loanword). I'll go with \"сахар\" since that's what's actually used in everyday Mongolian for sugar.\n\nNow I'm moving on to compile the translations for rice across the different language codes.

I'm looking at translations for \"cotton\" across multiple languages, and now moving into abstract social concepts like democracy with its translations across various language scripts and writing systems. I'm continuing through the translations, now looking at how \"democracy\" is expressed across Hungarian, Georgian, Tamil, Telugu, Burmese, Khmer, Amharic, Basque, Mongolian, Kazakh, and Uzbek. Moving on to the next word, \"freedom,\" starting with English.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the translations for freedom across Romance languages like Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian, Germanic languages including German and Dutch, plus Swedish, Russian, Polish, Hindi, Persian, Greek, Bengali, and Mandarin Chinese with its Japanese equivalent.\n\nContinuing through more languages... Continuing through the translations for justice across more languages—Russian, Polish, Hindi, Persian, Greek, Romanian, Dutch, Swedish, Bengali, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, and Vietnamese. I'm continuing through the translation data, now looking at the word \"revolution\" and its equivalents across different languages and writing systems.

Continuing through the translations for \"religion\" across more languages, including Polish, Hindi, Persian, Greek, Romanian, Dutch, Swedish, Bengali, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian variants. Now I'm looking at translations for \"law\" across different languages, continuing through the multilingual dataset with entries like Spanish \"ley,\" German \"Gesetz,\" Russian \"закон,\" and various other language variants. Continuing through the translations for \"war\" across different languages and scripts. I'm continuing through the multilingual translations, now filling in the remaining languages for \"war\" and moving into \"peace\" with its initial set of translations across major languages. Continuing through the translations for \"peace\" across more languages—Indonesian, Tagalog, Swahili, and several others from African, Asian, and European language families.\n\nNow moving on to compile translations for \"education\" across a similar range of languages, starting with major European languages and extending through Persian, Greek, Romanian, and Dutch. I've collected all the translations across the 40 languages, and now I'm ready to structure this into a JSON file with all 60 concepts and their multilingual variants. that's how they're typically presented in linguistic references. For the other languages, I'll stick with the standard citation forms I've already chosen.\n\nNow I'm ready to write out the full file with all the translations. Given how extensive this dataset is, I'll use the write function to create it efficiently. Before I do that, let me finalize a few more translation choices—particularly for Tamil, where \"விளையாட்டு\" works well for \"game\" since it covers both game and sport contexts naturally in that language.\n\nFor Khmer, I'm settling on \"រោងល្ខោន\" for theater, which specifically refers to the theatrical venue and performance space rather than cinema.\n\nNow I'm working through the remaining translations—for Swahili \"restaurant\" I'm deciding between \"mkahawa\" and \"restoranti,\" leaning toward \"mkahawa\" since it's more commonly used in East Africa despite being broader in meaning. For Mongolian, I'm using \"унадаг дугуй\" for bicycle and \"шар айраг\" for the traditional beer term, and I'm about to finalize the word for sugar.\n\nI'm also double-checking some of the less common terms across the other languages—verifying that \"электр\" works for Kazakh electricity, \"sharob\" for Uzbek wine, and working through the Hausa distinctions where \"giya\" covers beer while \"ruwan inabi\" more specifically refers to wine made from grapes.\n\nFor Yoruba, \"iná mọ̀nàmọ́ná\" is the proper standard term for electricity even though it's longer. I'm keeping it as is since it's the most accurate. Now I'm ready to compile everything and write out the file, though I'm still deciding between \"đài\" and \"ra-đi-ô\" for Vietnamese radio. it's the most common word for glass material. For Indonesian \"peace\", \"perdamaian\" is the proper noun form rather than the simpler adjective \"damai\", so I'll go with that. Now I'm ready to construct the JSON file, though I want to double-check the Thai word for \"law\" - \"กฎหมาย\" is correct.\n\nFor the remaining languages, I'm verifying some choices: the Burmese word for \"theater\" is \"ပြဇာတ်ရုံ\", the native Amharic word for \"dance\" is \"ጭፈራ\" rather than the loanword, and for Uzbek \"freedom\" I should use \"ozodlik\" over \"erkinlik\". For Mongolian \"office\", the loanword \"оффис\" seems to be the most widely used option.\n\nNow I'm ready to construct the full JSON file with all 60 concepts, making sure the structure is properly formatted with correct brackets and commas throughout."}]}}
