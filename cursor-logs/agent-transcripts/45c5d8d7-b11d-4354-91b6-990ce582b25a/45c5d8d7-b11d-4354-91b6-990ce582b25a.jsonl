{"role":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"The changes look good. Here's a summary of what I changed in `styles.css`:\n\n1. **`main` max-width**: Changed from `1000px` to `100%` so the page uses the full monitor width. Slightly reduced vertical padding (28px -> 20px top, 80px -> 60px bottom) and increased horizontal padding to 32px for comfortable edge spacing.\n\n2. **`section` padding/margin**: Tightened from `18px` padding / `16px` margin-top to `16px 20px` padding / `12px` margin-top, so sections are more compact.\n\n3. **`.controls` grid**: Changed from a single-column layout (`1fr`) to a **3-column layout** (`repeat(3, 1fr)`), so the Concept, Source Language, and Context Template inputs sit side-by-side. The language picker, toggle row, and run button still span the full width.\n\n4. **`h1, h2` margin**: Added `margin-bottom: 8px` to reduce space below headings.\n\n5. **`.sectionNote`**: Tightened bottom margin (14px -> 10px) and line-height (1.5 -> 1.4).\n\n6. **`.experiments`**: Reduced top margin from 32px to 20px.\n\nThese changes will make the page fill the screen horizontally and fit noticeably more content vertically without sacrificing readability."}]}}
