{"role":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Since I don't have browser automation capabilities, I cannot directly navigate to the page and take screenshots. However, I can help you understand what to look for and provide you with a checklist based on the code structure.\n\n## What You Should Check Manually\n\nBased on the HTML structure I reviewed, here's what to look for when you open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser:\n\n### **Sections to Check for \"Loading...\" Status:**\n\n1. **Translation Outputs** (div id=\"translations\")\n2. **Concept Manifold Cloud (PCA)** (div id=\"scatter\")\n3. **Cross-Language Similarity Matrix** (div id=\"similarity\")\n4. **Source Token Alignment Across Languages** (div id=\"attnUnified\")\n5. **Token-Pair Detail** (div id=\"attnDetail\")\n6. **Scientific Experiments section** with 4 experiment cards:\n   - Swadesh Convergence (div id=\"swadeshResult\")\n   - Color Circle (div id=\"colorResult\")\n   - Colexification (div id=\"colexResult\")\n   - Phylogenetic Distance (div id=\"phyloResult\")\n\n### **How to Check:**\n\n1. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`\n2. **Open Developer Tools** (F12 or right-click → Inspect)\n3. **Go to the Console tab** to check for JavaScript errors\n4. **Scroll through the entire page** and note:\n   - Which sections show \"Loading...\"\n   - Which sections have rendered charts (Plotly visualizations)\n   - Which sections are empty\n\n### **Expected Behavior:**\n\n- Initially, all visualization sections should be **empty** until you:\n  1. Select target languages using the preset buttons\n  2. Click \"Analyze Concept Geometry\"\n- The experiment sections should remain empty until you click individual \"Run Experiment\" buttons\n\n### **Common Issues to Look For in Console:**\n\n- Failed API calls (404 or 500 errors)\n- Plotly.js loading errors\n- CORS errors\n- JavaScript syntax errors\n\nWould you like me to help you debug any specific issues once you've checked the page? Or would you prefer I create a simple test script that can programmatically check the page structure?"}]}}
