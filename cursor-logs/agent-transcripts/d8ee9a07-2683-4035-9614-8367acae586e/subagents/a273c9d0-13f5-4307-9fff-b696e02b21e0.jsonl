Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/` (NOT `/blog` - that returns 404)\n2. Scroll down to section **6.6 Berlin & Kay Color Circle** (or click the navigation link)\n\n### **Expected Default View:**\n- **All languages checkbox**: ✓ Checked (should show 1,444 small transparent dots)\n- **Mean centroids checkbox**: ✓ Checked (should show 11 large labeled dots for: black, white, red, green, yellow, blue, brown, purple, pink, orange, grey)\n- **Family means checkbox**: ☐ Unchecked\n- **Lines to centroid checkbox**: ☐ Unchecked\n- **Color mode**: \"Actual Color\" button should be active (blue/highlighted)\n- **Family filter**: \"All families\" selected\n\nThe visualization should show:\n- Small transparent dots (opacity 0.25) colored by their actual color term\n- Large labeled dots showing the mean centroid for each color\n- Colors should be perceptually arranged in a circle pattern\n\n### **Test Sequence:**\n\n**1. Default View Screenshot**\n- You should see all 1,444 language-specific color term embeddings as small transparent dots\n- 11 large labeled centroids should be visible\n- Dots should be colored by actual color (red dots for \"red\", blue for \"blue\", etc.)\n\n**2. Uncheck \"Mean centroids\"**\n- The 11 large labeled dots should disappear\n- Only the small transparent language-specific dots should remain\n- This lets you see the raw distribution without the summary points\n\n**3. Check \"Family means\"** (with Mean centroids still unchecked)\n- Should now show family-level centroids (25 families × 11 colors = up to 275 points)\n- Each family's centroids should be labeled with the color name\n- Text should be colored by family color\n\n**4. Click \"Language Family\" color mode button**\n- Button should become active/highlighted\n- All dots should now be colored by language family instead of by color term\n- Should see 25 different family colors\n- Legend should update to show families\n\n**5. Filter by specific family** (e.g., \"IE: Germanic\")\n- Select \"IE: Germanic\" from the dropdown\n- Should show only 11 languages × 11 colors = 121 points for Germanic languages\n- Visualization should zoom in on just those points\n- If \"Family means\" is checked, should show only Germanic family centroids\n\n### **What to Look For:**\n\n✅ **Transparency working correctly**: Small dots should be semi-transparent (opacity 0.25-0.3), allowing you to see overlapping points\n\n✅ **Color mapping**: In \"Actual Color\" mode, colors should match their semantic meaning (red should look red, blue should look blue)\n\n✅ **Perceptual arrangement**: Colors should form a rough circle with perceptually similar colors adjacent (red near orange/purple, blue near green)\n\n✅ **Interactive controls**: All checkboxes and buttons should respond immediately\n\n✅ **Family filtering**: Dropdown should list all 25 families and filter correctly\n\n### **Potential Issues to Check:**\n\n❌ If dots are completely opaque, transparency isn't working\n❌ If you only see centroids and no small dots, the per_language data isn't rendering\n❌ If colors don't match semantically, COLOR_MAP might be misconfigured\n❌ If controls don't respond, JavaScript event listeners may not be attached\n\n---\n\nSince I cannot actually navigate and screenshot the page for you, could you please:\n\n1. Open `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser\n2. Navigate to the Berlin & Kay Color Circle section\n3. Follow the test sequence above\n4. Report back what you observe\n\nLet me know if the visualization renders correctly with all the transparency and controls working as expected!"}]}}
