I need to know: are the word translations in the Swadesh corpus REAL translations from a verified linguistic source, or were they AI-generated/fabricated?\n\nSearch for:\n1. The Swadesh corpus data file (likely a JSON file under backend/app/data/)\n2. The function that loads it (load_swadesh_corpus or similar in backend/app/benchmarks.py)\n3. Any scripts that GENERATED the translations (look for scripts that use GPT, NLLB translation, or other generation methods)\n4. Any README or documentation about data provenance\n\nKey things to check:\n- Is there a swadesh.json or similar file? What does it contain?\n- Were translations sourced from a real linguistic database (Wiktionary, ASJP, etc.)?\n- Or were they generated by a language model or translation API?\n- Check any scripts in backend/app/scripts/ that might have created the corpus\n\nReturn the structure of the Swadesh data file (first few entries), and any generation scripts you find. This is a data integrity audit.\n</user_query>"}]}}

Data file location\n- **File**: `/Users/kylemathewson/InterpretCognates/backend/app/data/swadesh_100.json`\n- **Structure**: 101 Swadesh concepts × 141 languages\n- **Loading function**: `load_swadesh_corpus()` in `backend/app/benchmarks.py` (lines 367-371)\n\n### 2. Metadata claims vs. evidence\n\n**Metadata states:**\n```json\n\"source\": \"Compiled from Wiktionary, ASJP, and standard Swadesh references\"\n\"expansion_note\": \"Original 40-language translations compiled from Wiktionary, ASJP, and standard Swadesh references. Additional translations compiled from published Swadesh lists, linguistic databases, and reference grammars. All expanded translations should be verified by native speakers before publication.\"\n```\n\n**Findings:**\n- No scripts fetch from Wiktionary or ASJP\n- No API calls or database queries to linguistic sources\n- Translations are hardcoded in `expand_swadesh_corpus.py`\n\n### 3. Translation source: expansion script\n\n**File**: `/Users/kylemathewson/InterpretCognates/backend/app/scripts/expand_swadesh_corpus.py`\n\n- Contains dictionary `T` with hardcoded translations (line 175+)\n- Example structure:\n```python\nT[\"cat_Latn\"] = [\n    \"jo\", \"tu\", \"nosaltres\", \"ell\", \"això\", \"allò\", \"qui\", \"què\",\n    \"cap\", \"cabell\", \"orella\", \"ull\", \"nas\", \"boca\", ...\n]\n```\n- Script expands from 40 to 141 languages by adding entries from `T`\n- No automated fetching or verification\n\n### 4. No AI generation scripts found\n\n- No GPT/OpenAI usage\n- No NLLB translation API calls for generation\n- No \"generate\" or \"fabricate\" scripts\n- Research docs note non-Swadesh translations are AI-generated, but not Swadesh\n\n### 5. Sample translations (appear plausible)\n\nFrom `swadesh_100.json`:\n- Spanish: \"yo\" (I)\n- French: \"je\" (I)\n- Russian: \"я\" (I)\n- Hindi: \"मैं\" (I)\n- Chinese: \"我\" (I)\n\nThese look correct, but there's no verification trail.\n\n### 6. Documentation notes\n\nFrom `research/sprint1_report.md` (line 172):\n- Non-Swadesh corpus: explicitly marked as \"AI-generated\"\n- Swadesh corpus: no such note\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Status**: Manually compiled, not systematically verified\n\n- Not AI-generated: no generation scripts found\n- Not programmatically fetched: no scripts query Wiktionary/ASJP\n- Manually entered: translations hardcoded in `expand_swadesh_corpus.py`\n- Verification gap: metadata claims sources but lacks verification; expansion note says \"should be verified by native speakers before publication\"\n\n**Recommendation**: Treat as unverified. The translations may be correct, but there's no evidence of systematic sourcing from the claimed databases. For publication, verify against Wiktionary/ASJP or have native speakers review.\n\n### Files examined\n1. `/Users/kylemathewson/InterpretCognates/backend/app/data/swadesh_100.json` - Main corpus file\n2. `/Users/kylemathewson/InterpretCognates/backend/app/scripts/expand_swadesh_corpus.py` - Expansion script with hardcoded translations\n3. `/Users/kylemathewson/InterpretCognates/backend/app/benchmarks.py` - Loading function\n4. `/Users/kylemathewson/InterpretCognates/research/sprint1_report.md` - Documentation"}]}}
