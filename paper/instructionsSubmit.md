## 1. Pre-Submission Checklist

Before starting the arXiv form, verify the following:

- [ ] Paper compiles cleanly: run `bash build.sh` from the `paper/` directory
- [ ] All 14 figures exist in `figures/` as PDF:
  - `fig_swadesh_ranking.pdf`
  - `fig_phylogenetic.pdf`
  - `fig_swadesh_comparison.pdf`
  - `fig_colexification.pdf`
  - `fig_conceptual_store.pdf`
  - `fig_color_circle.pdf`
  - `fig_offset_combined.pdf`
  - `fig_water_manifold.pdf`
  - `fig_category_summary.pdf`
  - `fig_isotropy_validation.pdf`
  - `fig_mantel_scatter.pdf`
  - `fig_concept_map.pdf`
  - `fig_offset_vector_demo.pdf`
- [ ] `output/stats.tex` exists and contains up-to-date computed values
- [ ] `build/main.bbl` exists (generated by BibTeX)
- [ ] No `\todo`, `\fixme`, or draft-only markers remain in any `.tex` file
- [ ] All author names and affiliations in `coverpage.tex` are final
- [ ] References in `references.bib` are complete (no "???" in the compiled PDF)
- [ ] The compiled `main.pdf` renders correctly with all figures, tables, and cross-references

---

## 2. Build the Submission Package

Run from the `paper/` directory:

```bash
bash build_arxiv.sh
```

This script:
1. Compiles the paper (if `build/main.bbl` doesn't exist yet)
2. Copies all `.tex` files, figures, `output/stats.tex`, and `main.bbl` into a temporary directory
3. Creates **`interpretcognates_arxiv.tar.gz`**
4. Cleans up the temporary directory

Verify the tarball contents:

```bash
tar -tzf interpretcognates_arxiv.tar.gz
```

Expected structure inside the tarball:

```
./main.tex
./preamble.tex
./coverpage.tex
./main.bbl
./sections/01-introduction.tex
./sections/02-background.tex
./sections/03-methods.tex
./sections/04-results.tex
./sections/05-discussion.tex
./sections/06-conclusion.tex
./output/stats.tex
./figures/fig_swadesh_ranking.pdf
./figures/fig_phylogenetic.pdf
... (all 14 figure PDFs)
```

**Important**: The `.bbl` file is included instead of `.bib` — arXiv processes the `.bbl` directly so BibTeX does not need to run on their servers.

## 3. arXiv Account

### If you don't have an account

1. Go to <https://arxiv.org/user/register>
2. Fill in: email, username, password, full name, affiliation
3. Verify your email address
4. You may need to wait for endorsement (see below)

### Endorsement

arXiv requires endorsement for first-time submitters in most categories. For `cs.CL`:
- Ask a colleague who has previously published in `cs.CL` to endorse you
- Endorsement link: <https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse>
- The endorser needs your arXiv username or email
- Endorsement is category-specific; you need one for `cs.CL`

### If you already have an account

Log in at <https://arxiv.org/login>

---

## 4. Start a New Submission

1. Log in to arXiv
2. Click **"START NEW SUBMISSION"** (top-right of the user dashboard)
3. You will be guided through a multi-step form

---

## 5. Form Fields — Step by Step

### Step 1: License

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **License** | Select one of the following (recommended in order): |

| License Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **CC BY 4.0** (recommended) | Allows reuse with attribution. Best for open science. |
| CC BY-SA 4.0 | Reuse with attribution + share-alike |
| CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 | Non-commercial + share-alike |
| CC0 1.0 | Public domain dedication |
| arXiv perpetual non-exclusive license | arXiv can distribute, but you keep all rights |

**Recommendation for this paper**: `CC BY 4.0` — maximizes visibility and reuse while requiring attribution.

You must also check the box confirming:
> "I have read and agree to the arXiv submission terms and conditions."

---

### Step 2: Classification (Categories)

| Field | Value to Enter |
|-------|----------------|
| **Primary Category** | `cs.CL` — Computation and Language |
| **Cross-list Categories** | `cs.AI` — Artificial Intelligence |
| | `cs.LG` — Machine Learning |

Optional additional cross-lists to consider:
- `cs.NE` — Neural and Evolutionary Computing (if emphasizing neural architecture analysis)
- `q-bio.NC` — Neurons and Cognition (if emphasizing cognitive science connection)

To select:
1. Choose **Computer Science** in the archive dropdown
2. Select **cs.CL** as the primary subject
3. Add cross-lists by selecting them in the secondary category list

---

### Step 3: Add Metadata

Fill in every field below.

#### Title

```
Universal Conceptual Structure in Neural Translation: Probing NLLB-200's Multilingual Geometry
```

> Use title case. arXiv allows LaTeX math in titles if needed, but this title has none.

#### Authors

```
Kyle Mathewson
```

Format rules:
- Full first and last names, one author per line
- If multiple authors: separate with commas or newlines
- Do **not** include affiliations here (those go in the paper itself)
- If an author has an ORCID, it can be linked via their arXiv user profile

#### Abstract

Copy the abstract from `coverpage.tex`, converting LaTeX to plain text. Replace all `\command{}` macros with their numeric values from `output/stats.tex`. The abstract should read as plain text with no LaTeX commands.

Example (fill in values from `output/stats.tex`):

```
Do neural machine translation models learn language-universal conceptual
representations, or do they merely cluster languages by surface similarity?
We investigate this question by probing the representation geometry of Meta's
NLLB-200, a 200-language encoder-decoder Transformer, through six experiments
that bridge NLP interpretability with cognitive science theories of multilingual
lexical organization. Using the Swadesh core vocabulary list embedded across
[NumLanguages] languages, we find that the model's embedding distances
significantly correlate with phylogenetic distances from the Automated
Similarity Judgment Program (rho = [MantelRho], p = [MantelP]), demonstrating
that NLLB-200 has implicitly learned the genealogical structure of human
languages. We show that frequently colexified concept pairs from the CLICS
database exhibit significantly higher embedding similarity than non-colexified
pairs (U = [ColexU], p = [ColexP], d = [ColexCohenD]), indicating that the
model has internalized universal conceptual associations. Per-language
mean-centering of embeddings improves the between-concept to within-concept
distance ratio by a factor of [ConceptualStoreImprovement], providing geometric
evidence for a language-neutral conceptual store analogous to the anterior
temporal lobe hub identified in bilingual neuroimaging. Semantic offset vectors
between fundamental concept pairs (e.g., man->woman, big->small) show high
cross-lingual consistency (mean cosine = [OffsetMeanConsistency]), suggesting
that second-order relational structure is preserved across typologically diverse
languages. We release InterpretCognates, an open-source interactive toolkit for
exploring these phenomena, alongside a fully reproducible analysis pipeline.
```

> **Tip**: arXiv accepts basic LaTeX in the abstract field (e.g., `$\rho$`, `$p < 0.001$`). You can keep the math formatting if you prefer.

#### Comments

```
14 figures; code and interactive toolkit available at https://github.com/[your-username]/InterpretCognates
```

Common items for the Comments field:
- Page count (e.g., "12 pages, 14 figures")
- Conference submission status (e.g., "Submitted to ACL 2026")
- Links to code/data repos
- "v2: revised based on reviewer feedback" (for updates)

#### Report Number

Leave blank unless your institution assigns report numbers.

#### ACM Classification

Optional. If you fill it in:
- `I.2.7` — Natural Language Processing
- `I.2.6` — Learning

#### MSC Classification

Leave blank (this is for mathematics papers).

#### Journal Reference

Leave blank for new preprints. Fill in later if/when the paper is accepted to a journal or conference proceedings.

#### DOI

Leave blank for new submissions. Add later if a publisher assigns one.

### Step 4: Upload Files

See [Section 6](#6-file-upload) below for detailed instructions.

---

### Step 5: Add Co-Authors (if applicable)

If there are co-authors:
1. Enter each co-author's name and email
2. They will receive a notification email
3. Co-authors can claim ownership of the submission on their arXiv profile

For this paper (single author), you can skip this step.

---

### Step 6: Preview

arXiv will compile your LaTeX and show a PDF preview. Check:
- [ ] Title and author render correctly
- [ ] Abstract displays properly
- [ ] All figures appear
- [ ] All references resolve (no "[?]" markers)
- [ ] Page layout looks correct
- [ ] Math symbols render correctly throughout
- [ ] No overfull hbox warnings causing text to run off the page

---

## 6. File Upload

### Option A: Upload the tarball (Recommended)

1. On the **Upload Files** step, click **"Choose File"**
2. Select `interpretcognates_arxiv.tar.gz`
3. Click **"Upload Files & Continue"**
4. arXiv will unpack the tarball and detect `main.tex` as the root file

### Option B: Upload files individually

If the tarball upload fails, upload each file individually:
1. `main.tex` (root file)
2. `preamble.tex`
3. `coverpage.tex`
4. `main.bbl`
5. `sections/01-introduction.tex`
6. `sections/02-background.tex`
7. `sections/03-methods.tex`
8. `sections/04-results.tex`
9. `sections/05-discussion.tex`
10. `sections/06-conclusion.tex`
11. `output/stats.tex`
12. All 14 PDFs from `figures/`

### File upload rules and limits

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Total upload limit** | 50 MB (compressed) |
| **Individual file limit** | 25 MB per file |
| **Allowed figure formats** | PDF, PNG, JPG, EPS (PDF preferred for vector graphics) |
| **Root file** | arXiv auto-detects `main.tex`; if ambiguous, you'll be prompted to select it |
| **No `.bib` files** | Include the compiled `.bbl` instead (already handled by `build_arxiv.sh`) |
| **No subdirectory nesting** | Keep directory structure flat or one level deep (our structure is fine) |
| **Filename restrictions** | No spaces, no special characters except `-` and `_` |

### Common upload issues

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| arXiv can't find root `.tex` file | Ensure `main.tex` is at the top level of the tarball |
| Missing figures | Verify all `\includegraphics` paths match the uploaded file paths |
| `.bbl` not found | Make sure `main.bbl` is at the top level (not inside `build/`) |
| Compilation timeout | Reduce figure file sizes (convert high-res PDFs with `gs -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook`) |
| Package not available | arXiv has a fixed TeX Live installation; check <https://arxiv.org/help/faq/texlive> for available packages |

### Packages used by this paper (all available on arXiv)

All packages in `preamble.tex` are standard and available on arXiv's TeX Live:
- `inputenc`, `amsmath`, `amssymb`, `graphicx`, `hyperref`, `booktabs`, `geometry`, `natbib`, `subcaption`, `xcolor`, `microtype`, `url`

---

## 7. Post-Upload Processing

After uploading, arXiv will:

1. **Compile your LaTeX** — This takes 1-5 minutes. You'll see a processing status page.
2. **Show compilation log** — Review for errors or warnings.
3. **Generate a preview PDF** — Compare this carefully against your local `main.pdf`.

### If compilation fails

1. Read the error log carefully
2. Common fixes:
   - Ensure `\bibliographystyle` and `\bibliography` commands match the `.bbl` file
   - Remove any local-only packages or custom `.sty` files not included in the upload
   - Check that all file paths are relative (no absolute paths like `/Users/...`)
3. Fix locally, rebuild the tarball, and re-upload

### If the preview looks wrong

- Figures missing: check that `\includegraphics{figures/fig_name}` matches the uploaded path
- Font issues: arXiv uses its own fonts; minor rendering differences are normal
- Layout differences: arXiv may use a slightly different TeX Live version

---

## 8. Final Preview & Submit

1. Review the preview PDF one final time
2. Verify all metadata fields are correct
3. Click **"Submit"**
4. You will see a confirmation page with a **temporary submission ID** (e.g., `submit/1234567`)
5. An email confirmation is sent to all listed authors

### Submission timing

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Announcement schedule** | Submissions finalized before **14:00 ET (Mon-Thu)** appear that evening |
| **Friday cutoff** | Submissions after 14:00 ET Friday appear Monday evening |
| **Hold period** | New submissions are held ~24 hours before announcement |
| **arXiv ID format** | `2602.XXXXX` (year-month prefix + sequence number) |
